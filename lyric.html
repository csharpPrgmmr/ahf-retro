                                When did tradition become more faithful than his word?<br><br>
                                Please just ask your self...What do you believe? How do you judge right from wrong? I don't claim to know anything at all. I've just learned to think for myself.

                                Should I feel this way, I'm tired of setting myself up to fail, I'm afraid that I'll never love again, I just don't think I could bear the pain, can you promise me you'll never leave, can you promise me I'll never cry, I'm sorry but I just don't think I can, I don't have enough strength to watch you die <br><br>
                                I know it's said, it's better to have loved and to have lost, than never to have loved at all<br><br>
                                Can you take my hand, you're the only thing I'll ever need, I'm sorry that I pushed you away, draw me close so I can learn to love, I'm afraid that I'll fail again, I can't promise that I won't fall down, but I pray that I'll never fade away, I don't have enough strength to watch you cry<br><br>
                                Now I know what I have to do, I'm letting go of everything but you, you've already died for me

I guess I will just sit here and cry until I'm satisfied, no I guess that's stupid I'm going to get on with my life<br><br>One day at a time<br><br>I realized today my mind has slipped away it comes and goes, the end must be near because I can't remember what happend two weeks ago last year, emotion ruled my life and I thought I would die everyday, but look at me I didn't die I'm surviving and I'm not living a lie<br>br>I thought I had it figured out and that would never be me, how could they be so blind they act so foolishly, I guess I didn't stop to think how I would react, I depended upon myself and look where I ended up

                                Cause I know that one day I'll leave this world, I'll go to place with streets of gold, then I'll see my Lord<br></br>

                                Society thinks I'm just a crazy kid, I need to grow up and get a life, You think your job is everything to you, God's not important anymore, Society thinks I'm just a crazy kid, I need to grow up and get a life, If what you have is what they seem to call a life, I don't want to grow up!!!

                                Christ gives me hope, My struggles can be overcome, This world won't get me down, The blood of Christ sets me free<br/><br/>
                                I forget, so easily, so many times, God has waited patiently, I'm so stubborn, the Lord is gracious, I gotta give it up, to the God of all nations...I can't do it, my destiny is sealed, My belief in Christ is genuine and real, I've stumbled, and I'll fall again, Christ has forgiven me, I'm free from sin<br/><br/>
                                Christ is Lord, Salvation is eternal

                                Modern biology owes me an apology, for the things they?ve said, what?s going on in their head, Darwin theology is total hypocrisy, they say something can?t come from nothing, then turn around and say it did<br/><br/>
                                I guess I?m crazy but I don?t believe everything I hear, just because my teacher said it doesn?t mean that it?s real, I believe anything Jesus tells me is so, I believe the Bible before any text book I know<br/><br/>
                                So let?s GO!! let?s GO...whoa!!

                                I know everything that I need to know and I have everything I need, I live my life for myself and not for someone else, I'm gonna do what I want to do and it doesn't matter what you say, I'm not lying to myself and I'll never need your help<br/><br/>
                                I'm so perfect I never mess up?yeah right I mess up all the time, why do I think that I'm better than the rest? I'm just a sinner saved by God's grace; I'm so smart I'm the coolest guy I know?yeah right I'm just a nobody, I always let my foolish pride get the best of me, I'm just another superficial jerk<br/><br/>
                                I thought I knew everything there was to know but I was so na�ve, I lived my life for myself without integrity, I'm gonna do what I need to do, I'm listening to what you say, I'm tired of lying to myself and I need your help<br/><br/>
                                I hope you understand what I'm trying to say, Jesus Christ my savior is the one and only way, since I've met him I've never felt alone, I hope you get the point of my sarcastic song

                                I fall, I cannot stand, without Christ I'm just a man, my hopes and dreams fade away, the blood of Jesus washed my sins away, I'm alone, I'm scared to death, you say you care but you don't care, all you do is sit and stare, I'm sold out for Jesus Christ and this is how I share<br/><br/>
                                You think you've got your life figured out, your in control of your petty little life, you don't need anyone to help you along the way, you'll get by just fine living day by day, it's an easy choice so why don't you decide, it's and easy choice there?s only two destinations<br/><br/>
                                I'm weak, I sin, I fall short of God's grace that he shed on me, but my destiny's sealed by the blood of the lamb, I'll trust in him, and he will see me through, I'm selfish, I'm undeserving of God's grace that he shed on me, I don't know why he loves me so, I'll trust in him, and he will see me through
