                        <p>*we just shot a video for ONE DAY AT A TIME...yeah I know, what do we think we are (rockstars?)...we were helping out a friend with a film school project...but from his other stuff I think it will look really cool...ask us about it at the show and we'll try to let you give it a look</p>
                        <p>*sorry the updates have been so far inbetween...we have about four new songs that we have started playing...so if you haven't been to a show lately be sure to come out and see what you think about the new stuff</p>
                        <p>*stickers have arrived and they are $1, our new CD is titled "A Little Less Thoughtful", it has 6 tracks and comes with a lovely pair of slippers for $5...if you would like to purchase something come see us play and find our table...we will be the ones wearing bad hair pieces and flowery dresses...
                        <p>*If you haven't seen one of our shows lately...we have aquired a new guitar player by the name of Shaun Fox...he was in such well known bands as Easily Amused and the Bee Gees...I think the addition adds a lot to our sound and stage performance.
                        <P>*We are doing a one week summer tour with odd man out...check the shows page for dates and info</p>
                        <p>*Please sign the guestbook on the main page.  I would like to get to know the people who come to our site.</p>
